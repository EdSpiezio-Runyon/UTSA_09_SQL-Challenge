## Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett-Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Instructions

1) Open password.py file, replace username and password fields with your information, and save. This prevents the upload of sensitive username and password information.

2) Open and run table_schemata_Ed_Spiezio-Runyon.sql.  This file establishes the tables and links the data from the associated .csv files.

3) Open and run queries_Ed_Spiezio-Runyon.sql. This file runs the queries needed to complete the 8 assigned tasks.

4) EmployeesSQL_db.sql is a combined file of the two sql files above.

5) Open ERD.png file.  This demonstrates the relations between various tables.

## Bonus
6) Open and run Pewlett-Hackard_analysis_Ed_Spiezio-Runyon.ipynb. This file provides the requested histogram and bar chart analyses of the .csv data.
